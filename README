# cpu_monitior

A System that has a built in dashboard and a monitor system featured capability. Data sizes are listed as bytes size for general layout for users and system 
purposes a data chart to be followed for system. Featured blocks are listed to be total block height "1 x 1 = 1000 x 1000"

A purpose of block break down and system collection builds data log a file folder with collacted hash scripts are gathered for filing and payouts of collacted hash. A built unit system cpu "computer proccessing units". "CPU" = a formal process of set projections of block size and built unit hash distrbuited processing heights processed by system. Data sizes are called hash , hash is gathered for payout processing limits are a version with no limitations following user and system protocol 
features are not focused unless accpected. Protocol featured system cpu processor of limited features and rendering units.

# DATA SIZES

KB = kilobytes 
MB = megabytes 
GB = gigabytes 
TB = terabytes 

Processing hash count and collection process is limited collections by a unit collection of accpected. Progress is collected and followed system purposes of 
collacted tranactions. Processed unit height is broken down for payout use and file purposing of rendered collection of "hash file" and "data size". Data collection 
sent to the processing file folder for collection and transaction hash payouts.
