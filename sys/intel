Highly-optimized implementations of the Fast SHA-256 cryptographic hash algorithm, which provide industry leading performance on a range of Intel® processors for a single data buffer
consisting of an arbitrary number of data blocks. 

SHA-256 is one member of a family of cryptographic hash functions that together are known as SHA-2. The basic computation for the algorithm takes a block 
of input data that is "512_bits", ("64 bytes") and a state vector that is "256_bits" , ("32 bytes") in size, and it produces a modified state vector.It is a 
follow-on to the earlier hash algorithms "MD5" and "SHA-1", and it is becoming increasingly important for secure internet traffic and other authentication 
problems. As the Fast "SHA-256" processing involves a large amount of computations, it is critical that applications use the most efficient
implementations available.

The standard for the "SHA-2" algorithm specifies a procedure for adding padding to the input data to make it an integral number of ("64-byte") blocks in length.
This happens at a higher level than the code described in this document. This paper is only concerned with updating the hash state values
for any integral number of blocks.

# Rounds_Digest

Digest Out The first step is a “message scheduler” that takes the input 16 DWORDs and
computes 48 new DWORDs. Together with the original 16 DWORDs, these
form a vector of 64 DWORDs that is the input to the second step.
This second step consists of 64 “rounds” where the form of the calculations in
each round is the same. Each round takes as input the 8 state DWORDs, the
corresponding input DWORD (after scheduling), and a round-specific
constant.
After all 64 rounds have executed, the resulting state vector is added to the
original state vector, and this results in the new state vector. If the input
consists of multiple blocks, this process is repeated for each block.
