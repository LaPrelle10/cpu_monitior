# System

System platform linux , mac , macos , andriod , windows , chrome , chromeos. Setup process for monitor is a watch system for cpu processing 
of storage space databytes broken down. 

# Blocks

Data blocks system with data storage space KB , MB , GB , TB (1000KB) = (1MB) / (1000MB) = (1GB) / (1000GB) = (1TB) data block sizes of kilobytes , megabytes , 
gigabytes and terabytes data sizes in blocks to be broken down for mining process 

# Virtual Machine 

linux system has a virtual machine allowed for the cpu mining process able to render and break down features applied for cpu mining process intel for 
process. Build a virtual system for cpu process. Data packets broken and consumed for data transfering into currency with cpu usage and bandwidth 

# Bandwidth 

Bandwidth process is applied to a valued feature cpu block processor for open system connection required for cpu mining.
